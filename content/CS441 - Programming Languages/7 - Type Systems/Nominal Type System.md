A type system is considered **nominal** if [[CS441 - Programming Languages/7 - Type Systems/Type Compatibility]] and [[CS441 - Programming Languages/7 - Type Systems/Type Equivalence]] are both determined by explicit declarations (the name) of the type.

This is in contrast to the [[CS441 - Programming Languages/7 - Type Systems/Structural Type System]] approach.
