# Discussion: C Is Not a Low-Level Language

* [Spectre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)), [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability))
* At any given moment, C compiler has to correctly predict ~25 branches. This is *tough*
* In hardware, register renaming engine

```c
for (j = 0; j < k; j++) {
	A[j] = A[j] + 1
}
```

Can we parallelize this loop? The compiler needs to determine whether the loops are independent.

```c
// This block of code...
while ( ... ) {
	if ( ... ) { ... }
	else { ... }
}
// ...may be translated by the compiler to
// something similar to the following:
if ( ... ) {
	while ( ... )
} else {
	while ( ... ) { ... }
}
```

What if we have a term in our `if` that becomes undefined in the second arrangement? Not specified by the language.

If you're writing on a vintage PDP-11 or even an older 6502, it might be true that you're relatively close to the metal. These days not so much, but the language has evolved with the intent of preserving that illusion so people still believe it.

## What Do We Do?

We need to find better models of designing languages towards the hardware.

Trying to determine what we can and cannot parallelize from loop structures is super difficult.

Cache coherency!

We need:
* a large number of threads
* wide vectors
* not much cache
* a *much* simpler memory model.
