# Functional Languages

## Historical Origins

* 1920s: set theory is all the rage
	* Whitehead and Russell's [Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica)
	* Godel comes along and throws a wrench into it
		* if it's consistent, it's not powerful enough to prove its own consistency
	* Question: what is decidable?
* 1930s
	* [[People/Alonzo Church]]: lambda calculus
	* one of Church's PhD students.. [[People/Alan Turing|Turing]] or something? comes up with an abstract tape machine
* In effect: a program is a *constructive proof* of the proposition that, given any appropriate inputs, there exist outputs related to that input in a particular way.
	* Later: Curry-Howard correspondence

## Big Ideas

* Data is immutable
* Functions are pure
	* no side-effects
* Functions can be *composed*

## Advantages

* Lazy evaluation
* Memoization
* Trivial concurrency
* Compactness

**Homoiconicity**: the primary representation of programs is also a data structure in a primitive type of the language itself.

## Evaluation Order

* Subcomponents of many expressions can be evaluated in ==more than one order==.
	* applicative-order: evaluate arguments before the function call
	* normal-order: pass arguments unevaluated (thunks)

**Hygienic macros**: lexically scoped, integrated into language semantics, immune from problems normal macros suffer from

## Strictness

A side-effect-free function is said to be **strict** if it's undefined when any of its parameters are undefined. Such a function can evaluate all of its arguments, so can safely use applicative order.

**Trivial Update Problem**: what happens if we need to change 1 item in a million item collection?
* reference counting
* tail recursion
