* Why are signals disabled during scheduler calls?
	* When a signal comes in, something needs dealing with
	* Problem: if we're in the middle of a context switch...
		* some registers backed up but not all
		* item ready to be inserted to queue but not actually in
	* Disable signals just long enough to do what we need without interruption
* Cooperative multithreading
	* Everybody's being good and keeping track of how long they've had the scheduler
	* Not a bad idea, but requires everyone to cooperate
* Stack layout
	* page 416
* Blocking
	* busy waiting/spinlock
	* someone's waiting for some condition to change
		* generally changed by another thread
	* CAS
		* Can't get a total deadlock ==ever== - the only way to invalidate one thread's operation is when some other thread is making progress

```go
r1 := x
r2 := f(x)
r3 := CAS(x, r1, r2)
if !r3 {
	goto start
}
```

* Are barriers similar to blocking?
	* typically long queue of work units, smaller queue of threads
* Cache coherence/memory consistency
	* especially hard under NUMA
	* shared memory: just write a message to the shared bus telling every core to invalidate
	* basically all you can do is apply synchronization or use memory fencing
		* put everything into critical section
	* Need to understand how ==temporal loops== work
* Temporal loops
	* chapter 13, slide 44
	* cores will disagree about what order
	* `volatile`: this needs to be synchronized on
