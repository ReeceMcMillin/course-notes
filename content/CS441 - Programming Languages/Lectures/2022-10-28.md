# Logistics
- Overview of [[CS441 - Programming Languages/Wiki Project/Wiki Project - SQL]]
- Need to set an exam date soon
- Chapters 6 and 7 are fair game for quizzes
- Definitely some garbage collection material on exam 2 
- 

# Lecture
## Garbage Collection
- Mark and Sweep
	- Mark everything as garbage
	- Walk the heap, anything we reach is *not* garbage (clear the mark)
	- All garbage blocks get moved to the *free list*
	- **Problem**: doesn't address fragmentation
	- **Solution**: Stop & Copy
- Stop and Copy
	- similar to mark and sweep, but as we find reachable (live) memory, we copy it down to the region of the stack to build a non-fragmented region of live heap memory.
	- Mark and sweep is one of stop and copy's *building blocks*
- Generational collection
	- This is basically stop and copy with a twist
	- Stop and copy ends up with a nice defragmented heap
	- With each block, also keep track of which cycle we moved it there on.
		- If it's lived more than a couple 1 or 2 cycles, move it into a special *long-term* region where we presumably won't need to rearrange things as often.
		- Key idea being that program entities tend to either be very transient or very long-lived
	- Requires a pretty strong type system - we benefit quite a bit from static knowledge of the layout of everything in memory
	- What if our language isn't strongly typed?
		- not likely that any random bit of data would happen to have a bit pattern that *looks like* a pointer
		- step through static data one step at a time, if it *looks* like a pointer we go ahead and mark that memory as reachable
		- we aren't checking type
		- will never reclaim a useful block *as long as the programmer never obscures a pointer*
- Reference counting
	- Have to keep an extra piece of data on *every object* - this ~~is~~ can be pretty significant overhead
	- **Problem**: can't handle cycles
* Lists

## Extra - MapReduce

Map an operation over every element in a list, then fold a particular operation over the mapped list (reduce).

```scheme
> (map sqr '(1 2 3 4 5))
> '(1 4 9 16 24)
> (reduce + (map sqr '(1 2 3 4 5)))
> 54
```
