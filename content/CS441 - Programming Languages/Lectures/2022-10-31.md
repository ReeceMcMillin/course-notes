## Stack Layout (Review)

Each subroutine gets a **stack frame** at the top of the stack with
* arguments
* return values
* bookkeeping information
	* return addresses
	* saved registers
* local and temporary variables
* stack pointer contains the address of the last used location at the top of the stack (or first unused location depending on convention)
* Frame pointer register contains an address *within* the frame

## Calling Sequences

The code executed by the caller immediately before and after a function call is the **calling sequence**.
* **Prologue**:
	* Parameters must be passed
	* Save return address
	* Update program counter
	* Stack pointer changed to allocate space
	* save registers (including frame pointer) that contain values that may be overwritten
	* initialize data/objects that require it
* **Epilogue**: undo everything in the reverse order
* All the code in the prologue is attached to the body of the subroutine
* **Problem**: we have a fixed number of registers. How do we know which registers we need to save?
	* Ideally, save only what's live in the caller *and* what will be needed by the callee.
		* This is usually difficult or impossible to determine (because of separate compiilation).
	* Ideas:
		* Caller saves anything they'll need
		* Callee saves and restores anything it's going to overwrite

## Maintaining Static Links

The caller has to do *some* of the work to maintain static chain. Usually the caller computes the callee's static link and passes it as an extra (hidden) parameter.
* Two subcases:
	* Callee nested *inside* the caller
	* Callee is $k \geq 0$ scopes "out".
		* Every scope that sur
* Generally want to precompute at compile time
	* Some languages use dynamic scoping which traces back through functions that have actually been called, but not common anymore

## Putting It All Together

1. The *caller*:
2. Before the call (during the prologue) the *callee*:
3. After the call (during the epilogue) the *callee*:
4. Finally, the *caller*:

## Inline Expansion

Inlining function calls avoids the overhead of stack allocation entirely! No saving/restoring registers, maintaining the static chain, etc.

[[CS441 - Programming Languages/6 - Control Flow/Tail Recursion]]: instead of allocating a new stack frame, just reuse the same variables in memory

## Parameter Passing

* **Formal Parameters**: parameters that appear in the *declaration* of a subroutine.
* **Actual Parameters (arguments)**: variables and expressions which are passed to a subroutine at *runtime*.

### Parameter Modes

* **Pass-by-Value**: $p(x)$ is given a *copy* of $x$'s value.
* **Pass-by-Reference**: $p(x)$ is given $x$'s *location in memory*.

Why pass by reference?
* Copying actuals to formals takes time, especially for large data structures.
* It's faster to just send the sarting address of an array rather than a copy of the whole thing.


### Variations

* [[CS441 - Programming Languages/Languages/ALGOL#ALGOL-W]] introduced *call-by-value/result*
	* In this method, the value of the argument is copied into the subroutine.
* [[CS441 - Programming Languages/Languages/Clu]] introduced **Call-by-Sharing**

### Hybrid Types

(slides)

### `READONLY` parameters

* Introduced by [[CS441 - Programming Languages/Languages/Modula-3]]
* Provides the efficiency of pass-by-reference with the *safety* of pass-by-value
* `READONLY` parameters can't be changed by the subroutine
	* could only be passed to other subroutines if `READONLY` was maintained
* C has an equivalent with the ability to pass `const` pointers
	* C++ has `const` references

### R-Value References

C++ introduced **r-value references**, the ability to pass an r-value (such as a built-up expression) by *reference*.

### Closures as Parameters
