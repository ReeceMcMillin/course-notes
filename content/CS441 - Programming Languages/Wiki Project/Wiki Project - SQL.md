# Components

## Overview

- [ ] Type of language
- [ ] When/where the language was written
- [ ] Why the language was written
- [ ] Primary uses for the language
- [ ] Notable features

## History

**Big Idea**: talk about why someone thought the language was needed, what went into it, and how it worked out.

- [ ] Primary design features
- [ ] Original language goals
- [ ] Design process
- [ ] What need was it built to address?
- [ ] What sets the language apart from what came before it?
- [ ] What changes were made from ancestor languages (if there were any)?
- [ ] How widely was it used, and in what areas?
- [ ] Is the language still in use? Why/why not?
- [ ] What were the major versions or revisions (if any)?
- [ ] Were parts of it adopted into other languages, or did it become a dead end? Why?

## Features

- [ ] Description (in some detail)
- [ ] Bare minimum requirements
	- [ ] Native data types
	- [ ] Control structures
- [ ] Classify based on the following criteria:
	- [ ] Imperative/object-oriented/functional/declarative/etc.
	- [ ] Strong vs. weak typing
	- [ ] Static vs. dynamic typing
	- [ ] How are iteration/selection handled (if at all)?
	- [ ] What features does it support?
- [ ] Where does the language really shine?
- [ ] What are its biggest drawbacks?
- [ ] Does the language have any particularly arcane features?

## Feature Evaluation

**Big Idea**: Answer each question, but more importantly *support each position*.

- [ ] How readable is the language?
- [ ] How writeable?
- [ ] Is the language highly orthogonal?
- [ ] How expressive is the language?
- [ ] How well does it support abstraction?
- [ ] How does its execution speed compare to other languages of the same era?

## Examples

* Ideas
	* CTEs
	* JOINs

## Summary Evaluation

**Big idea**: cover your overall view and 2-3 things a user needs to know/ought to consider about the language

- [ ] Final conclusions/comments about the language
- [ ] Has the language been a success?
- [ ] What's the language best at?
- [ ] What are the language's drawbacks?
- [ ] What are the significant tradeoffs? Were they worthwhile?
