1. What causes the wind to flow from east to west instead of pole to equator
	* Rotation of the earth
2. Are Polar Cells thermally direct or thermally indirect?
	* Thermally *direct* - air rises in warm areas while sinking in cold areas
3. Imagine a polar bear swimming South from polar regions to find land. He can either go to Alaska or Russia. Where will he land?
	* He'll follow the polar easterlies and head West to Russia.
4. Are Ferrel cells thermally direct or thermally indirect?
	* Thermally *indirect* - warm air sinks
	* Think of Ferrel cells as a *consequence* of the thermally direct Hadley/Polar cells
