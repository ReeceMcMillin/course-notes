# Wind
**Primary Circulation**: general global circulation
**Secondary Circulation**: related to migratory high-/low-pressure systems
**Tertiary Circulation**: local winds, temporal weather patterns
* Meridional flows move along meridians
* Zonal flows move along parallels
* Winds are named for the direction from which they *originate*

## Driving Forces
* **Pressure gradient** force (main driver)
	* Wind results from a *horizontal* difference in air pressure
	* Isobar: equal pressure line
	* 
* **Coriolis** force: deflection
	* Due to rotation of the Earth
	* Northern Hemisphere deflects to the *right*
	* Southern Hemisphere deflects to the *left*
* **Friction** force: slowing-down

## Models
### Single-Cell Model
* Strong heating at the equator causes
	* less dense air to rise
	* diverge towards the pole
	* sink back to surface
	* then return to equator
* **Problem**: predicts that surface winds would flow straight towards the equator
### Single-Cell with Rotation
* Also called the **Coriolis Effect**
	* Hadley described this model 100 years before the Coriolis force was mathematically expressed in 1835
* ITCZ: Intertropical Convergence Zone
* Even with rotation, the single-cell model doesn't explain the winds blowing from the west in mid-latitudes and the subtropical desert.
### Three-Cell Model
* Idea: divide the circulations in each hemisphere into three cells:
	* **Hadley** Cell (tropics/subtropics)
		* *thermally direct* - driven by thermal energy
		* Strong solar heating leads to rising air, diverges towards the poles
			* creates *equatorial lows* (low pressure), lots of precipitation
		* Higher air moves towards the poles, gradually acquiers a west-to-east motion
		* Air descends towards 30$^\circ$ latitudes to form *subtropical highs* - desert conditions
	* **Ferrel** Cell (middle latitudes)
		* Air flows away from subtropical highs towards subpolar lows, acquires a large westerly component due to the Coriolis force
	* **Polar** Cell (high latitudes/polar regions)
		* Surface air moves from polar highs (extremely cold) to subpolar lows (relatively warm)
* Is this realistic? Yes and no!
	* Yes
	* No
		* Doesn't take into account land-sea contrasts, topography information
