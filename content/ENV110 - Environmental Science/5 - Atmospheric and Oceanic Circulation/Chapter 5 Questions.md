1. What is the relationship between **air pressure** and **density**? What about **air pressure** and **temperature**?
2. What is the difference between an **isotherm** and an **isobar**?
3. What are **geostrophic winds**? What are their two components?
4. What are the three components of **surface winds**?
5. How does the spacing of **isobars** on a weather map relate to wind speed?
6. How would surface winds travel on a non-rotating Earth?
7. In which direction does the Earth rotate?
8. How does the **Coriolis force** appear to deflect atmospheric and oceanic circulations?
9. Describe how the **Coriolis force** changes as a function of latitude.
10. As you travel from the *North Pole* to the Equator, does the **Coriolis force** push you East or West? Why?
	* How is this different from travelling from the Equator to the North Pole?
	* How do these answers change if you travel from/to the *South Pole* instead?
11. Why do high- and low-pressure areas exist in the atmosphere?
12. How is upper-air circulation, especially the *ridges* and *troughs*, related to surface-pressure systems?
13. Why is *warm* air typically associated with *low*-pressure areas? Why is *cold* air typically associated with *high*-pressure areas?
14. At the surface, **prevailing westerly winds** are most often located in which latitudinal zone?
15. During the day, people on the coast of Florida will usually experience a *cool sea breeze*. Describe the mechanisms that cause this effect.
16. During the day, people in a mountain valley will usually experience a *cool mountain breeze*. Describe the mechanisms that cause this effect.
17. Areas with *low* atmospheric pressure are typically warmer and wetter than areas with *high* atmospheric pressure. Why?
18. What does it mean for air to **converge**? **Diverge**?
19. When air **converges**, does it typically rise or fall? What weather pattern does this create?
20. How does atmospheric convergence/divergence relate to *surface* air temperature?
21. Explain the connection between **divergence aloft** and **suface lows**.
22. Explain the connection between **convergence aloft** and **surface highs**.
23. The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) is characterized by **convergence** and **uplift** of warm surface air. Explain why this is the case.
24. What is a **Rossby wave**? What force causes it?
25. Describe the **jet streams**.
	* What conditions cause jet streams to form?
	* How might they affect airline schedules for the trip from New York to San Francisco?
	* How might they affect the return trip to New York?
26. Explain the causes of changing wind patterns between night and day in *coastal* areas.
	* What similar patterns develop in mountains and valleys?
27. Describe the seasonal pressure patterns that produce the Asian **monsoon** circulation.
28. What force causes the wind to flow from east to west instead of pole to equator?
29. Imagine a polar bear swimming South from polar regions to find land. He can either go to Alaska or Russia. Where will he land?
30. Are **Polar Cells** thermally *direct* or thermally *indirect*? Why?
31. Are **Ferrel Cells** thermally *direct* or thermally *indirect*? Why?
32. Due to the rotation of the Earth, wind in the Northern Hemisphere is deflected to the (East/West) of its original movement. What is the name for this effect?
33. What is the main atmospheric driver of oceanic **surface currents**?
34. What drives **thermohaline circulation**? Describe the correlation between temperature, density, and salinity.
