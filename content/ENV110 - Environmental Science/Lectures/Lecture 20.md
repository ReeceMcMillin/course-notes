# Three States of Water & Energy Transfer

| Release | Absorption |
|:-:|:-:|
| Freezing | Melting |
| Condensing | Evaporating |
| Depositing | Sublimiation |

> [!QUESTION] QUESTION
> 
> If you go from gaseous water to liquid water, is energy absorbed or released?
> 
> * **How to Answer**: gas particles have higher energy than particles in liquids, think of the gas particles bouncing around a bunch.

# Atmospheric Moisture

**Water Vapor Pressure** is the pressure of water vapor in the air, expressed in terms of *partial pressure*.

## Humidity

**Humidity** refers to water vapor content in the air.

* Primarily a function of air temperature.
	* moisture condenses in cool air
	* warm air has more moisture capacity

**Relative Humidity** refers to the ratio of water vapor prsent to maximum *potential* to hold water vapor.
$$\text{relative humidity} = \frac{\text{actual water vapor in the air}}{\text{maximum possible (at that temperature)}} \cdot 100\\%$$

Since warmer air has a higher maximum capacity for water vapor, the same *actual* humidity will have different *relative* humidities at different temperatures and times of day.

**Specific Humidity** is the mass of water vapor per unit mass of air.
* The maximum specific humidity is positively correlated with temperature.
* Key idea: warmer air holds mor ewater vapor.

### Saturation and Dew-Point Temperature

**Saturation** refers to the state at which relative humidity is 100%.

**Dew-Point Temperature** is the temperature at which:
* a given mass of air becomes saturated
* net condensation begins to form water droplets.

> [!NOTE] NOTE
> 
> Dew-point temperature is always *less than or equal to* the actual temperature.


> [!QUESTION] QUESTION
> 
> A kilogram of air at $40 ^\circ C$ has a specific humidity of $12g$, so what is the *relative humidity*?
> 
> * **How to Answer**: use the maximum specific humidity chart.
> 
> What is the *dew-point temperature*?
>
> * **How to Answer**: find the point on the curve where the maximum specific humidity is $12g$. In this case, the answer is somewhere around $15 ^\circ C$.


How are temperature and humidity related?

Air temperature determines ability to evaporate or condense vapor.

* Air temperature and <u>relative</u> humidity are *inversely* related.
	* **Daily**: Remember, as temperature increases the air gains a higher capacity for water vapor. As the day warms up, the *relative* humidity will drop.
	* **Seasonally**: Winter has a lower overall temperature
* Air temperature and <u>maximum specific</u> humidity are *positively correlated*.

Atmospheric moisture content has a large impact on the meteorological prediction of clouds and precipitation.

## Clouds

### Cloud Formation Processes

A **cloud** is a group of water droplets and ice crystals.
* Warm clouds are above $0^\circ C$.
* Cold clouds can be below $-40 ^\circ C$.
* Mixed-phase clouds have both water droplets and ice crystals.


> [!NOTE] How to Build a Cloud
> 1. Air is cooled by vertical lift.
> 2. Air parcel cools to the dew-point temperature.
> 3. Air parcel becomes saturated.
> 4. Condensation occurs.

Condensation requires a certain amoun t of foreign particles larger than $10^{-4}mm$ called **cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)**.
* Natural sources
	* meteroic dust
	* windblown clay and silt
	* volcanic material
	* smoke from forest fires
	* sea salt
* Anthropogenic sources
	* combusting products (sulfur and nitrogen compounds)
* The concentration of anthropogenic CCN is *much* higher than that of natural sources.

### Cloud Seeding

**Cloud Seeding** is the process of artificially introducing cloud condensation nuclei to increase precipitation.

1. Silver iodide is released by a plane or ground-based generator.
2. Silver iodide particles reach the targeted cloud.
3. The silver iodide aids in the formation of ice crystals.
4. The ice crystals become large enough to fall and create snow.

**Cloud droplets** are extremely small, between 0.0001mm to 0.2mm.
* in contrast, a typical raindrop is between 0.4mm and 4mm.

### Cloud Types

By altitude:
* Low (up to 2000m)
* 

## Fog

**Fog** is a cloud layer in contact with the ground.

* Fog occures when the *air* temperature and *dew-point* temperature on the ground are nearly identical.
* Near the ground, air is *saturated*.

## Precipitation

**Precipitation** occurs when water droplets or ice crystals become large enough to fall due to gravity.
* In *warm clouds*, this occurs because of the **drop collision-coalescence** mechanism.
	* As cloud droplets fall through a cloud, they'll collide and coalesce with smaller cloud droplets.
	* Raindrops grow in size and fall to the ground without evaporating.
* In *cold clouds*, water vapor

# Midterm Review

Both of these will likely be on the exam in some form, he might switch #2 around a little bit.

1. Most freshwater is contained in
	* streams
	* lakes
	* **ice and glaciers**
	* groundwater
	* soil moisture
2. The process of a solid transforming directly into a gas is
	* **sublimation**
	* condensation
	* deposition
	* evaporation
