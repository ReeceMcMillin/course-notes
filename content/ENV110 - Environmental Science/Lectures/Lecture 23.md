- Rain shadow: a dry area on the leeward side of a mountainous area (away from the wind)
	- *Leeward* is the opposite of *windward* - the side of the mountain facing the wind.
	- The prevailing wind blown in from the west (Pacific Ocean), it blows precipitation 
- Frontal lifting
	- A **front** is the transition zone between two air masses of different densities.
	- Since density differences are most often caused by temperature differences, fronts usually separate air masses with contrasting temperatures
	- The leading edge of a cold air mass is called a **cold front**.
		- Precipitation runs *behind* the cold front.
		- Indicated by blue triangles on weather maps.
	- The leading edge of a warm air mass is called a **warm front**.
		- Precipitation runs *ahead* of the warm front.
		- Indicated by red half-circles on weather maps.
* Midlatitude Cyclonic Systems
	* Migrating low-pressure weather systems that occur in the midlatitudes, outside of the tropics
	* spin caused by all 3 wind forces (pressure gradient, coriolis, friction)
* **Nor'easter**: fueled by *warm* air over coastal waters from the Gulf Stream meeting *cold* air over East Coast land
	* Typically happen between late Autumn and early Spring
* Thunderstorms
	* energy source is from the *condensation* ofa large amount of water vapor in the clouds.
* Tornados
	* Extends downward from a cumulonimbus cloud (deep convection cloud)
	* Energy comes from the *condensation* of a large amount of water vapor in clouds
