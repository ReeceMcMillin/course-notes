**Tropical Cyclones** are rotating storm systems which originate over warm, tropical waters.

# Energy Source

Tropical cyclones are powered by the **latent heat** of condensation. The warmer the ocean and atmosphere, the more powerful the storm.

> Why don't we see hurricanes form along the equator?
> 
> Tropical cyclones are *rotational* storms - this requires energy contribution by the Coriolis Force, which is very weak along the Equator.

Around the eye is the **eyewall**, which is the region with the most intense precipitation.

* Category 1: some damage to homes
* Category 2: extensive damage to homes, major roof and siding damage
* Category 3: devastating damage, removal of roofs and gables
* Category 4: catastrophic damage, severe damage to roofs and walls
* Category 5: catastrophic damage, total roof failure/wall collapse on high percentage of homes

# Seasonality
