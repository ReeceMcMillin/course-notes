A **tornado** is a violently rotating column of air extending downwards from a cumulonimbus - deep convection - cloud.

* Tornados can range from a few meters to over 4 kilometers in diameter and can last anywhere from a few seconds to tens of minutes.
* Energy comes from the condensation of a large amount of water vapor in clouds.

# Development

Wind shears occur when stronger winds higher in the atmosphere overtake weaker winds closer to the surface, causing a rolling motion along the horizontal axis.

As a thunderstorm forms, air is pulled up (updraft). Surface air flows in on the surface and continues to rotate and lift into a *supercell*.
* Clouds form an *anvil* structure above the top of the thunderstorm.

# EF Scale

* **EF-0 (Gale)**: "minor" damage
	* 65-85mph winds, about highway speed
* **EF-1 (Weak)**: "moderate" damage
* **EF-2 (Strong)**
* **EF-3 (Severe)**
* **EF-4 (Devastating)**
* **EF-5 (Incredible)**
	* up to 200mph wind

# Tornado Alley

The **tornado alley** phenomenon is a result of the convergence of cold, dry air and warm, moist air converging on the American midwest.

Over the last several decades, we've noticed a dramatic increase in tornados to the East of what we typically consider Tornado Alley[^1]. We still don't have a perfect explanation for this expansion, but the warming climate trend seems to be a good fit.

# Seasonality

**Tornado Season** typically runs from April to July with a peak in May (followed closely by June). This trend has *increased* in recent decades.
