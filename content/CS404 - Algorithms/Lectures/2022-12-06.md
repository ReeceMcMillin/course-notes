# For Final Exam

* Review the midterm
* can have laptop or cell phone

## Example Questions

### Dijkstra

1. Dijkstra's algorithm is greedy algorithm
2. Is Dijkstra's algorithm similar to Prim's vs. Kruskal's?
3. Given a weighted graph, $L(V) =$ ? (multiple choice)

### Minimum Spanning Tree

general definitional questions:
1. T/F: a spanning tree does not have cycles and **can** be disconnected

Given some image of a network, produce the MST (or just the cost)

### Dynamic Programming

Know definitions, general strategies

1. What is the difference between divide and conquer and dynamic programming? ==Bottom-up vs. top-down==
2. What are the steps of dynamic programming?
3. What are the qualities of a dynamic programming solution? (optimal substructure etc)

### Network Model

1. Given a graph, calculate the maximum flow.

### Older Stuff

1. Given a heap and index $i$, what is the index of $i$'s' left child? right child? ($2i+1, 2i+2$)
2. Define "complete binary tree"
3. What is the difference between a max-heap and a min-heap?
4. T/F does this image of heap match a given array?
5. What does "heapify" mean?
6. Pseudocode/general structure of ==heapify== routine
7. Know general strategy for constructing max-/min-heap
8. Given some pseudocode, name the routine

### Algorithms

* know all big-O
* Stable

# Review

* All acyclic graphs are bipartite.
* A connected acyclic graph is known as a **tree**
* A possibly disconnect acyclic graph is known as a **forest**

Bipartite graphs are ==two-colorable==
