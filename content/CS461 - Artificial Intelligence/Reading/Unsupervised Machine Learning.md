# Cluster Analysis

## K-Means

## K-Means++

## Hierarchical Clustering

## C-Means

## K-Nearest Neighbor

# Classifiers

## Linear Classifiers (Regression)



## Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

* Extend the idea of linear separation into *hyperplane* separation

# Principal Component Analysis

* Used to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by grouping features together
* Not always easy to determine *why* two features might be grouped together (if there's any good reason at all)

# Association

# Hebbian Learning

* "Neurons that ==fire== together ==wire== together"
	* neurons with similar activation levels (high or low) have their connections strengthened
	* 

# Method of Moments

# Supervised vs. Unsupervised
