# Types
* [[CS461 - Artificial Intelligence/5 - Logic/Predicate Logic]]
# Other Logics
Everything we've seen so far is **[[Monotonic.md]]**: once it's in the knowledge base, it can't be removed
## Second-Order Logic
*"A predicate must exist that satisfies these properties"*
* Gives you enough power to approach Godel's Incompleteness Theorem
* First order logic will not let you say *"all statements with an inductive proof are true"

## Fuzzy Logic
Allows us to express degrees of uncertainty about the truth value of something

## Modal Logic
Deals with beliefs, moral imperatives
* "Ought implies can"
* "It is possible..."
* "It is necessary..."

## Temporal Logic
