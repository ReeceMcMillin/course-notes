# Logistics

Exam is Monday 2022-11-07

* 5-9 is all fair game, 8 is pretty hard
* Will have resolutions
	* Forward/backward chaining
		* Advantages/disadvantages of each
		* How to use each when proving a statement from a KB
	* Know why some pair will or won't resolve
	  $$\begin{align*}
	  a &\vee b \vee c\\
	  \neg{a} &\vee \neg{b} \vee c\\
	  \hline
	  &\text{doesn't resolve}
	  \end{align*}$$
* Gotta know Bayes' Theorem (and how to convert English statements to probabilistic statements)
  $$\begin{align*}
  P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \mid B) P(B)}{P(A \mid B)P(B) + P(A \mid \neg{B})P(\neg{B})}
  \end{align*}$$
	* $P(tumor) = 1\cdot 10^{-5}$
	* $P(test \mid tumor) = 0.999$
	* $P(test \mid \neg{tumor}) = 0.001$
	* $P(tumor \mid test) = ?$
* Some first-order logic
	* All $x$ are $y$ becomes $\forall{n}: x(n) \implies y(n)$
	* Some $A$'s are $B$ becomes $\exists{x}: A(x) \wedge B(x)$
	* Example:
		* All genies ride carpets
			* $\forall{x}: G(x) \implies C(x) \equiv \neg{G(x)} \vee C(x)$
		* Aladdin rides carpets
			* $C(Aladdin)$
		* Therefore, Aladdin is a genie.
			* Try to 
			* $\neg{G}(Aladdin) \vee C(Aladdin)$
				* We want to show Aladdin is a genie, so add a clause saying he isn't and find a resolution.
			* $\neg{G}(Aladdin) \vee C(Aladdin)$
			* $\neg{G(Aladdin)}$
				* ..nothing to resolve here!
		* What if we say all genies *and only genies* ride carpets?
			* $\forall{x} : G(x) \iff C(x)$
				* $G(x) \implies C(x) \equiv \neg{G(x)} \vee C(x)$
				* $C(x) \implies C(x) \equiv \neg{C}(x) \vee G(x)$
			* Now our predicates:
				* $\neg{G(Aladdin)} \vee C(Aladdin)$
				* $\neg{C(Aladdin)} \vee G(Aladdin)$
				* $C(Aladdin)$
			* Take 2 and 3 - resolves to show $G(Aladdin)$.
* Know high-level ideas of specific technologies like DENDRAL/MYCIN/PROSPECTOR (but we're not going deep into history)
