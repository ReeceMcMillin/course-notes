# Questions

* Should we expect specific questions from readings/videos?
* vanishing gradient
	* as we go through backpropagation, multiplying small numbers by small numbers quickly pushes towards zero
	* fix: as we get towards earlier layers, increase the learning rate
* unstable gradient
	* either it's heading towards 0 or it's increasing exponentially
	* fix: *reduce* the learning rate
* one-hot vs. multi-hot
* powerpoints
	* abuses of AI (red team, security)
	* temporal difference learning (backgammon slides)
	* how convolutional networks work
		* LSTM networks
		* why do we need a convolutional filter for images
	* unsupervised learning slides
		* [[CS461 - Artificial Intelligence/Lectures/2022-12-05|lecture here]]
* different methods of splitting data
	* k-fold cross-validation
		* pick some value for $k$, divide data into $k$ sets, every set gets a turn at being training data
		* leave-out-one (**LOO**) cross-validation
			* kind of the inverse of k-fold, all but one are training
* activation functions
	* should we understand scenarios when 
	* rectified linear is quickly becoming the most commonly used
		* converge faster, we don't ==really== know why
* auto-encoders
	* still supervised
* reinforcement
	* make a decision
