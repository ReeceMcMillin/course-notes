Where does uncertainty *come from*?
* Partial observability
* Nondeterminism
* Both?

We could track some sort of *belief state* - out of every possible state, which one might we be in? Except...
* Pretty large search space
* We'd like a pretty reasonable plan for every contingency

**Rational Decision**: Maximum likelihood of success *at acceptable cost*
* In other words, maximum expected utility.
* $$E(x) = \sum{x} \cdot P(x)$$
**Diagnostic Problem**: 
**Ontological Commitment**: what is *true*
* There are rules that do or do not hold in any particular case
**Epistemological Commitment**: What is or can be *known*
* What we can *know* about particular rules is limited

## Utility Theory
**Idea**: every decision has some utility
* $$\text{utility} = \sum{\text{gains}} - \sum{\text{costs}}$$Every agent sets their own utility function
	* Doesn't have to match anybody else's!

## Terminology
* ***Possible worlds**
	* Mutually exclusive
	* Exhaustive
	* *"Every possible world exists and is distinct from each other"*
	* $$0 \leq P(\omega) \leq 1$$
	* $$\sum_\omega{P(\omega)} = 1$$
	* $$P(\text{event}) = \sum{P(\text{worlds where event occurs})}$$
	*
