## Idea
Extension of [[Frames.md]]
* adds information about sequences of events and planning

**Key concept:** conceptual dependency #key-concept
* Classify relations between objects and properties

Scripts can be arranged hierarchically and used in [[Production Systems.md]]

## Problems
* Lack important concepts
	* "What color shoes was Lincoln wearing during the Gettysburg address?"
	* Script didn't know Lincoln being in Gettysburg meant his feet were in Gettysburg!
* Can be very effective in microworlds but are very limited in general understanding.
